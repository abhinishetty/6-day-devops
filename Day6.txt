namespace->dividing cluster  into isolated environments...…
default "":it is ceated automatically by kubernets 
kube-node-lease:to check the heslth of node kubernestes master nodes use this objects
 kube-public      :anyone can able to axess the resources in this namesspace
 kubectl get all -n kube-system  in the time of cluster creation like metric server,cni, core dni all resources will create in this namespace
 
when we are deploying application production servers we will never deploy any application in the default namespace

if the pod goes down there are 3
1:we are going to get application downtile-to overcome this prblm we have to attach contrls  to the pod
2.every pod has own ip address if pod goes down the ip address will change-to overcome this orblm we have to create services in Kubernetes .it will create static url
3.if pod goes down along with the pod we are going to loose the data-to overcome this prblm we have to implement vlumes in kubernetes


replica set:
replica set is a Kubernetes object .it is going to maintain minimum number of nodes 24X7(replica set is always maintain the diresred state=actual state)


replicaset prblms:
in real time application we don't rcomment replica set becz we cznt able to perform roleout,roleback operations 

deployments-in cubernetes we are deploying appilcations using deployment objects or deployment controller...deployment will manage replicaset .replicaset will manage the pods

if we want to expose application through web browser Kubernetes will introduce objects called services.
3 types  of service
1.cluster ip service
2. nodeport service
3.loadbalancer service

we are going to implement loadbalancer service now

monitoring: to understand whats going inside the application we are implementing monitoring dashboards with the help of monitoring dashboards we can recognise if something goes wrong in the application also we can able to identify how much cpu,how much memeory,ports,cpu can be identified

monitoring tools like promthus,grafana
promthus is a metric server where it is going to collect time series of data it sends data to graphana dashboards

grapha :with hep of graphana we can set up monitoring dashboards where we  can see your data in the form of piecharts,graphs
